    "How to Fine-Tune LLMs in 2024 with Hugging Face\n",
    "===============================================\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial comes from  [Fine-tuning LLMs with Hugging Face](https://www.philschmid.de/fine-tune-llms-in-2024-with-trl?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst).\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models or LLMs have seen a lot of progress in the last year. We went from no ChatGPT competitor to a whole zoo of LLMs, including Meta AI's [Llama 2](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf), Mistrals [Mistral](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2) & [Mixtral](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1) models, TII [Falcon](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b), and many more. Those LLMs can be used for a variety of tasks, including chatbots, question answering, summarization without any additional training. However, if you want to customize a model for your application. You may need to fine-tune the model on your data to achieve higher quality results than prompting or saving cost by training smaller models more efficient model.\n",

    "When fine-tuning LLMs, it is important you know your use case and the task you want to solve. This will help you to choose the right model or help you to create a dataset to fine-tune your model. If you haven't defined your use case yet. You might want to go back to the drawing board. I want to mention that not all use cases require fine-tuning and it is always recommended to evaluate and try out already fine-tuned models or API-based models before fine-tuning your own model.\n",

    "As an example, we are going to use the following use case:\n",
    "\n",
    "> We want to fine-tune a model, which can generate SQL queries based on a natural language instruction, which can then be integrated into our BI tool. The goal is to reduce the time it takes to create a SQL query and make it easier for non-technical users to create SQL queries.\n",

    "* Using existing open-source datasets, e.g., [Spider](https://huggingface.co/datasets/spider)\n",
    "* Using LLMs to create synthetically datasets, e.g., [Alpaca](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tatsu-lab/alpaca)\n",
    "* Using Humans to create datasets, e.g., [Dolly](https://huggingface.co/datasets/databricks/databricks-dolly-15k).\n",

    "\n",
    "Each of the methods has its own advantages and disadvantages and depends on the budget, time, and quality requirements. For example, using an existing dataset is the easiest but might not be tailored to your specific use case, while using humans might be the most accurate but can be time-consuming and expensive. It is also possible to combine several methods to create an instruction dataset, as shown in [Orca: Progressive Learning from Complex Explanation Traces of GPT-4.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02707)\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example we will use an already existing dataset called [sql-create-context](https://huggingface.co/datasets/b-mc2/sql-create-context), which contains samples of natural language instructions, schema definitions and the corresponding SQL query.\n",

There are also several ways on how we could improve the performance by using few-shot learning, using RAG, Self-healing to generate the SQL query."

    "You can now deploy your model to production. For deploying open LLMs into production we recommend using [Text Generation Inference (TGI)](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference). TGI is a purpose-built solution for deploying and serving Large Language Models (LLMs). TGI enables high-performance text generation using Tensor Parallelism and continous batching for the most popular open LLMs, including Llama, Mistral, Mixtral, StarCoder, T5 and more. Text Generation Inference is used by companies as IBM, Grammarly, Uber, Deutsche Telekom, and many more. There are several ways to deploy your model, including:\n",
